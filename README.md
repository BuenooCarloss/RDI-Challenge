# RDI-Challenge

This project was created with Swagger visualization. Since the data is stored in memory, the data will be erased once the project is terminated. I have security concerns regarding access to this fictional API. In the case of an API with a database, I would create a privilege rule for its use.

I used the Internet for support while coding since it has been a long time since I coded in C#. I also didn't create unit tests as it's been a while since I've done that.

In this project, we have endpoints for:

Creation of Customer
Creation of Card for a Customer
Creation of Customer with Card together
(when creating only a customer, an empty wallet is automatically generated for them)
